**Biosignatures China Summary**

**Business case**



*   [^1]China is estimated to be the second largest health industry behind the USA.


*   It increased 10% between 2018 and 2019, with rapid growth over the last five years. In 2019 it was estimated to be worth US$1.1 trillion.
*   Government policies, such as Healthy China 2020 and 2030, have been put in place to promote risk reduction and encourage healthier lifestyles[^2], and to address health inequity in the overall population.Health outcomes in China continue to be dependent upon geography[^3].
**Ageing populations**



*   “The global population aged 60 years or over numbered 962 million in 2017, more than twice as large as in 1980 when there were 382 million older persons worldwide. The number of older persons is expected to double again by 2050, when it is projected to reach nearly 2.1 billion.”[^4] “Globally, the number of older persons is growing faster than the number of people in all younger age groups.”


*   China’s population is 1,439,323,776 in 2020, with 11.5% aged over 65 with an estimated annual growth rate of 2.3%[^5].

**Focus**

Having reviewed mortality rates in China, we have chosen to focus on areas where there is a clinical need, and where there is evidence in the scientific and academic literature that the technique that we use could be an effective way of identifying the disease.

Initially we have focussed on :



*   **COPD** 
*   **Alzheimer’s Disease** and other dementias 
*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis**, 

**Digital Health Providers**



*   “Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, China’s digital healthcare market was already posited to reach RMB 23.5 billion (US$3.29 billion) by 2020. However, the outbreak has caused a massive acceleration in the use of telehealth services – prompting healthcare providers, patients, and insurers to adopt telehealth tools much more readily than before.”[^7]

        The Bain & Company survey, completed in 2019, estimated that 24% of Chinese respondents had used telemedicine.

*   PingAn Good Doctor, the largest “online medical service” provider in China, saw their online medical services revenue grow by over 100% in the 12 months to August 2020, with a 26% increase in daily online consultations over the same period[^8].
