    The change in glycosylation of the two acute-phase proteins, alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor 


    (API) and haptoglobin (Hp), in progressive ovarian cancer is different. This has been shown 


    by monosaccharide analysis and lectin-binding studies of proteins purified from serum. In …

    Background: Clinically, it is still challenging to differentiate aggressive from non-aggressive 


    prostate cancers (Pca) by non-invasive approaches. Our recent studies showed that 


    overexpression of alpha (1-6) fucosyltransferase played an important role in Pca cells. In this …

    Introduction: Pro or precursor forms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have emerged as 


    potentially important diagnostic serum markers for prostate cancer detection. Immunoassays 


    were developed to measure specific proPSA forms containing propeptides of 2, 4, and 7 …
